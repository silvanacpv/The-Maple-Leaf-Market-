This project was developed as a prototype for the Murphy Centre Hackathon 2025 in St. John's, NL. 
Its goal is to help Canadians discover, support, and buy from local businesses, artisans, and producers.
By making local shopping more accessible, we aim to strengthen communities and promote a sustainable economy.
