This project was developed as a prototype for the Murphy Centre Hackathon 2025, held in St. John's, NL.
Its mission is to help Canadians discover, support, and shop from local businesses, artisans, and producers across the country.

By making local shopping more visible and accessible, the platform aims to:
- Strengthen local economies
- Support community-based entrepreneurs
- Promote sustainable consumption
